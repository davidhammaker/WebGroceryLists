# WebGroceryLists
A better way to manage shopping lists.

## Description
_WebGroceryLists_ allows users to create, manage, and share grocery lists with friends and family.
The web-app is still in development, but functional versions will be released as they are completed.

## Roadmap
The following stages are tentatively planned for this project:
* Functional single-page web-app
	* The application will be able to handle one list for a single user.
	* During its early stages, this will be a proof-of-concept list that will not retain information if the user refreshes/revisits the page.
	* In the later stages, the user will be able to save a list. This could be done most easily by downloading the list, but a list could possibly be saved on the site by using cookies.
* Backend-supported web-app with database
	* Users will be able to log in and save lists to a database.
	* Early stages of this step will still have only one list, but support for multiple lists will be implemented quickly.
	* We may also use this time to allow users to add descriptions/images to their lists for added convenience.
* User collaboration
	* Users will be able to share lists and allow others to collaborate on lists.
	* More advanced features may allow users to group friends together (family, roommates, surprise party volunteers, etc.).
